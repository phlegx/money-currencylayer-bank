## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

~~~ ruby
# Minimal requirements.
require 'money/bank/currencylayer_bank'
mclb = Money::Bank::CurrencylayerBank.new

# New endpoint: https://apilayer.com/marketplace/currency_data-api or
# old endpoint: https://currencylayer.com/product
mclb.access_key = 'your access_key'

# (optional)
# Use the old endpoint api.currencylayer.com. By default, the new endpoint is used.
mclb.currencylayer = true

# (optional)
# Set the base currency for all rates. By default, USD is used.
# CurrencylayerBank only allows USD as base currency for the free plan users.
mclb.source = 'EUR'

# (optional)
# Set the seconds after than the current rates are automatically expired.
# By default, they never expire, in this example 1 day.
mclb.ttl_in_seconds = 86400

# (optional)
# Use https to fetch rates from CurrencylayerBank.
# CurrencylayerBank only allows http as connection for the free plan users.
mclb.secure_connection = true

# (optional)
# Rescue with rates from the cache instead of reporting an error when the endpoint fails.
mclb.rescue_with_cache = true

# Define cache (string or pathname).
mclb.cache = 'path/to/file/cache'

# Update rates (get new rates from remote if expired or access rates from cache).
# Be sure to define the cache first before updating the rates.
mclb.update_rates

# Force update rates from remote and store in cache.
# Be sure to define the cache first before updating the rates.
# mclb.update_rates(true)

# Set money rounding mode.
Money.rounding_mode = BigDecimal::ROUND_HALF_EVEN

# Set money default bank to Currencylayer bank.
Money.default_bank = mclb
~~~

### More methods

~~~ ruby
mclb = Money::Bank::CurrencylayerBank.new

# Returns true if configured to use the old endpoint.
mclb.currencylayer

# Returns the base currency set for all rates.
mclb.source

# Returns true if configured to rescue rates from the cache.
mclb.rescue_with_cache

# Expires rates if the expiration time is reached.
mclb.expire_rates!

# Returns true if the expiration time is reached.
mclb.expired?

# Get the API source url.
mclb.source_url

# Get the rates timestamp of the last API request.
mclb.rates_timestamp

# Get the rates timestamp of loaded rates in memory.
mclb.rates_mem_timestamp
~~~

### How to exchange

~~~ ruby
# Exchange 1000 cents (10.0 USD) to EUR
Money.new(1000, 'USD').exchange_to('EUR')        # => #<Money fractional:89 currency:EUR>
Money.new(1000, 'USD').exchange_to('EUR').to_f   # => 8.9

# Format
Money.new(1000, 'USD').exchange_to('EUR').format # => â‚¬8.90

# Get the rate
Money.default_bank.get_rate('USD', 'CAD')        # => 0.9

### Using gem money-rails

You can also use it in Rails with the gem [money-rails](https://github.com/RubyMoney/money-rails).

~~~ ruby
require 'money/bank/currencylayer_bank'

MoneyRails.configure do |config|
  mclb = Money::Bank::CurrencylayerBank.new
  mclb.access_key = 'your access_key from https://currencylayer.com/product'
  mclb.update_rates

  config.default_bank = mclb
end
~~~

### Cache

You can also provide a Proc as a cache to provide your own caching mechanism
perhaps with Redis or just a thread safe `Hash` (global). For example:

~~~ ruby
mclb.cache = Proc.new do |v|
  key = 'money:currencylayer_bank'
  if v
    Thread.current[key] = v
  else
    Thread.current[key]
  end
end
~~~

## Process

The gem fetches all rates in a cache with USD as base currency. It's possible to compute the rate between any of the currencies by calculating a pair rate using base USD rate.

## Tests

You can place your own key on a file or environment
variable named TEST_ACCESS_KEY and then run:

~~~
bundle exec rake
~~~
